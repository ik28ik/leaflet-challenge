### Visualizing Data with Leaflet

This repo contains homework from the Leaflet lecture series from The Columbia Engineering Data Analytics Boot Camp.

The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. Using JSON, the data was pulled for the visualization.

Using Leaflet, was created a map that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude. The markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and darker in color. There are popups included that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.


The legend provides context for the map data.
